"""E-082 cadence-restart throughput probe: orchestrator.

PRE-REGISTERED 2026-10-11. See runs/diac/e82_gen/cadence.yaml for the design.

WHAT IT DOES: launches the real arm-C-workload trainer, lets it run past a step
target, STOPS it, verifies the newest periodic checkpoint actually loads, then
relaunches the exact original command with zero flags (auto-resume). Three
cycles, two restarts, 12,000 steps total.

WHY: E-081 (closed, accepted) observed that one stop/relaunch cleared the
945 MHz clock latch and restored the full fast mode (~23 s/100) for about 3,600
steps. n=1. This probe tests reproducibility of that window on a cadence.

SAFETY: strictly sequential. The next launch happens only after the previous
process is confirmed gone AND no train.py process remains, so there is never a
GPU co-run. Only processes this script started are stopped.

PRE-REGISTERED RULE (fixed before launch):
  Per-cycle rate r_i = seconds per 100 steps over the probe-free range of cycle
  i, read from monitor/log.jsonl. t RESETS on each resume, so only the final
  monotonically-increasing segment of each process is used.
    CADENCE WORKS iff every restart cycle has r <= 30 s/100
    CADENCE FAILS iff any restart cycle is >= 60 s/100 for the majority of steps
    PARTIAL       otherwise
  SECONDARY: fast-window length in steps per cycle, and the clock state.
  This is a THROUGHPUT calibration, not a model result.
